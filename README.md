## What is Spllit?

Spllit is a trusted social platform for sharing everyday costs — starting with travel.
Whether you're a student heading to campus or a professional commuting to work, Spllit connects you with verified co-travelers on your route — so you can connect, split, and save — securely.
It begins with ride-sharing, but that's just the start.
From movies to trips, food to events — if you can split it, you can Spllit it.
One platform. Every shared experience.

## What Problem Does Split Solve?

Millions of Indians — Mostly students and professionals — face:

**High daily transport costs:**
Example: A student commuting to exams or a professional heading to work may spend ₹300–₹400/day on cabs or bike taxis. Over a month, that adds up to ₹9,000–₹12,000.
This is especially painful during exam seasons, interviews, and in cities with few public transport options.

**Lack of a verified co-travel network:**
There's no trusted app where you can safely find peers to split rides with — especially for college, coaching, exams, or shared routines.

**Safety and trust issues:**
Pooling with strangers from random WhatsApp or Telegram groups feels risky. People worry about scams, harassment, and general discomfort, especially women.

**Overcrowded Roads & CO₂ Emissions**
India ranks among the top global emitters.
Urban India is choking under traffic. Single-occupancy ride culture floods the streets with cabs, bikes, and cars — causing more traffic, longer commute times, and massive air pollution.

## Spllit: The Solution

Verified ride-sharing that saves money, cuts traffic, and builds community.

### Broader Problems Spllit Tackles

**Traffic Congestion:**
India's urban centers like Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, and Mumbai are crippled by traffic due to excessive single-occupancy vehicle use.
Spllit promotes shared rides, reducing the number of vehicles on roads.

**Air Pollution & CO2 Emissions:**
Shared mobility reduces per-capita emissions by pooling multiple riders into one vehicle.
Example: Carpooling reduces up to 1.6 tons of CO2 per person annually (source: EPA, USA).

**Inclusion & Affordability:**
Makes commuting accessible to students, interns, and job seekers, especially in Tier 2 & 3 cities where public transport is limited.

**Verified, Secure Ride Matching:**
Split lets users discover verified co-riders from their college, office, or exam centers. No random strangers — just people like you, heading the same way.

**Smart Matching for Shared Travel:**
Enter your destination, time, and gender preference — get matched instantly.
See who's heading the same way and split the ride.

**Safety-First Design:**
Real-time location tracking, gender preference matching, and in-app chat after match.
Co-travellers ratings and behavior scores based on previous trips.
